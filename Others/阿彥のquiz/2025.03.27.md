1. Let traingle $A$ $B$ $C$ be equilateral, with $A$ $B$ $= 1$ . Show that if we select 10 points in the interior of this triangle, there must he at least two whose distance apart is less then $\frac{1}{3}$.(20%)$_{10}$
2. Please prove following question.(30%)$_{21}$
	1. Let $S \subseteq Z^+$. What is the smallest value for $\left|S\right|$ that guarantees the existence of two elements $x, y \in S$ where $x$ and $y$ have the same remainder upon division by 1000?(10%)
	2. What is the smallest value of $n$ such that whenever $S \subseteq Z^+$ and $\left|S\right| = n$, then there exist three elements $x,y,z \in S$ where all three have the same remainder upon division by 1000?(10%)
	3. Write a statement that generalizes the results of part (1) and (2) and Example 5.42.(10%)
	4. Appendix Example 5.42:
		 Let $S \subset Z^+$, where $\left|S\right|$ = 37. Then $S$ contains two elements that have the same remainder upon division by 36.
