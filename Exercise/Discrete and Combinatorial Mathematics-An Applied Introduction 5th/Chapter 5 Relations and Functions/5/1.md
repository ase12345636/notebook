- Example 5.40:
	Larry returns from the laundromat with 12 pairs of socks (each pair a different color) in a laundry bag. Drawing the socks from the bag randomly, he'll to draw at most 13 of them to get a matched pair.
- In example 5.40, we have 12 colors (because each pair a differenet color) and have 24 socks in the bag.
- So that, socks are pigeon and colors are pigeonhold.
