In arithmetic sequence, we know that $a_{n}=a_{1}+(n-1)d$ , so $n=\frac{a_{n}-a{1}}{d}+1$.
In $S = \{3,7,11,15,19,...,95,99,103\}$ , we can know $S$ is a arithmetic sequence and $a_{1} = 3$, $a_{n} =103$, $d = 4$, $n = \frac{103 - 3}{4}+1  = \frac{100}{4}+1 =26$.
Subdivide the set $S$ into two parts. One is the two number can sum 110, the other one is don't have element which is sum 110.
- Part I: can sum 110.
	\{7, 103\}$, $\{11, 100\}$, $\{15, 99\}$, ......$\{51, 59\}$(note: $a_{13}=51$) $\rightarrow$ have 12 subsets
- Part II: cannot sum 110.
	$\{3\}$, $\{55\}$ $\rightarrow$ have 2 subsets

So, we subdivide into 14 parts. By the pigeonhole principle, subsets are pigeonholes and numbers are pigeons. We have 14 pigeonholes, so we at least have $14 + 1 = 15$ pigeons(number) that at least two number whose sum 110.
