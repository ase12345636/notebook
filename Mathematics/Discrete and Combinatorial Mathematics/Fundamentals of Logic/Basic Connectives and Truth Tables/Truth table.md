In some sentence, having a variable value. Its truth value cannot be determined until a numberical value is assigned.
	- e.g: The number $x$ is an integer.

For foregoing discussion, we use turth table to list all of possible for compound statements.

In all [[Basic Connectives]] turth table like:

| $p$ | $\neg p$ |
| --- | -------- |
| 0   | 1        |
| 1   | 0        |

| $p$ | $q$ | $p \land q$ | $p \lor q$ | $p \underline{\lor} q$ | $p \rightarrow q$ | $p \leftrightarrow q$ |
| --- | --- | ----------- | ---------- | ---------------------- | ----------------- | --------------------- |
| 0   | 0   | 0           | 0          | 0                      | 1                 | 1                     |
| 0   | 1   | 0           | 1          | 1                      | 1                 | 0                     |
| 1   | 0   | 0           | 1          | 1                      | 0                 | 0                     |
| 1   | 1   | 1           | 1          | 0                      | 1                 | 1                     |
