### Statement
Sentence that are either true or false, but not both.
- e.g: 2+3 = 5, Terry is a boy.

Sentence that is **exclamation** or **command** are not statement.
- e.g: What a beautiful evening!

Statement usually use lowercase letters of the alphabet.
- e.g:  $p$: Terry is a boy, $q$: 2 + 5 = 7

**Primitive Statements**: a statement that cannot be broken down into a simpler form.
### Basic Connectives
1. $\neg p$ : For a statement, transformed true to false, and vice versa. It is read as "Not $p$".
	- e.g: 
		- $p$: Terry is a boy. 
		- $\neg p$: Terry is **not** a boy.
2. $p \land q$(Conjunction): For two statements, they are combined using a conjunction. It is read as "$p$ and $q$".
	- e.g:
		- $p$: Terry is a boy.  
		- $q$: Lisa is a girl. 
		- $p \land q$: Terry is a boy **and** Lisa is a girl.
3. $p \lor q$(Disjunction): For two statements, they are combined using a disjunction. It is read as "$p$ or $q$".
	- e.g:
		- $p$: Terry is a boy.
		- $q$: Lisa is a girl.
		- $p \lor q$: Terry is a boy **or** Lisa is a girl.
	- Sometimes we call "or" "*inclusive* or". On the other hand, we call the other connective "*exclusive* or".
4. $p \underline{\lor} q$: For two statements, they are combined using disjunction, but not both. We call this connective "*exclusive* or".
	- e.g:
		- $p$: Terry is a boy.
		- $q$: Lisa is a girl.
		- $p \underline{\lor} q$: Terry is a boy **or** Lisa is a girl, but not **both**.
	- Sometimes we write exclusive or as "xor".
5. $p \rightarrow q$(Implication):  Alternatively we can say this connective as:
	1) $p$ implies $q$.
	2) If $p$, then $q$.
	3) $p$ is sufficient for $q$.
	4) $p$ is a sufficient condition for $q$.
	5) $p$ only if $q$.
	6) implicaton of $q$ by $p$.
	7) $q$ whenever $p$.
	8) $q$ is necessary for $p$.
	9) $q$ is necessary condition for $p$.
	10) $q$ if $p$
