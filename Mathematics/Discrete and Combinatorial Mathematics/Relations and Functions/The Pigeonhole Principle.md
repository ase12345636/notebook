> If m pigeons occupy n pigeonholes and m > n, the **at least one** pigeonhole has two or more pigeons roosting in it.

- e.g. 
	- Problem: An office employs 13 file clerks, so at least two of them must have birthdays during the same month.
	- Solve:
		- clerks -> pigeons
		- months of year -> pigeonholes
		- So that, we have 13 pigeons and 12 pigeonholes. By pigeonhole principle, this problem is true.
