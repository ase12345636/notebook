-  $p \leftrightarrow q$(Biconditional): For a two statements, they are combined using biconditional. It is read as "$p$ if and only if $q$" or "$p$ is necessary and sufficient for $q$".
	- e.g: 
		- $p$: Terry is a boy.
		- $q$: Terry is a human.
		- $p \leftrightarrow q$: Terry is a boy if and only if Terry is a human.
	- We sometimes abbreviate "$p$ if and only if $q$" as "$p$ iff $q$".
