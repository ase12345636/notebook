- $p \underline{\lor} q$: For two statements, they are combined using disjunction, but not both. We call this connective "*exclusive* or".
	- e.g:
		- $p$: Terry is a boy.
		- $q$: Lisa is a girl.
		- $p \underline{\lor} q$: Terry is a boy **or** Lisa is a girl, but not **both**.
	- Sometimes we write exclusive or as "xor".
