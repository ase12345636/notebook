2. Catrina selects three integers from {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9} and then forms the six possible three-digit integers (leading zero allowed) they determine. For instance, for the selection 1, 3, and 7, she would from the integers 137, 173, 317, 371, 713, and 731. Prove that no matter which three integers she initially selects, it is not possible for all six of the resulting three-digit integers to be prime. (20%)
3. Show that 1(1!) + 2(2!) + ....... + n(n!) can be expressed as difference of two factorials for n= 1, 2, 3 (we assume 0! = 1) (20%)
4. Consider the premutations of 1, 2, 3, 4. The premutaion 1432 is said to have one **ascent** (sinece 1 < 4) and two **descents** (since 4 > 3 and 3 > 2). Suppose a permutation of 1, 2, 3, ......, m has $k$ ascents, for $0 \leq k \leq m - 1$. How many desents does the permutation have? (20%)
