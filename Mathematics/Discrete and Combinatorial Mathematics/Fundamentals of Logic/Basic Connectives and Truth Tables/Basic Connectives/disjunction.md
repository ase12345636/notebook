 - $p \lor q$(Disjunction): For two statements, they are combined using a disjunction. It is read as "$p$ or $q$".
	- e.g:
		- $p$: Terry is a boy.
		- $q$: Lisa is a girl.
		- $p \lor q$: Terry is a boy **or** Lisa is a girl.
	- Sometimes we call "or" "*inclusive* or". On the other hand, we call the other connective "*exclusive* or".
